Custom Fine-tuned GPT-4 for Organizations
This repository contains a Python script that helps you prepare and fine-tune a GPT-4 model based on your organization's source code. Fine-tuning the model with your organization's specific codebase allows you to generate more accurate and context-aware code suggestions and autocompletions. This can be extremely beneficial for companies, as it streamlines the development process and enhances developer productivity.

Use Cases
By using a custom fine-tuned GPT-4 model, organizations can benefit in several ways:

Context-aware code completion: The model can provide code completions that are more relevant to your organization's codebase, leading to faster development and fewer errors.
Better understanding of organization-specific concepts: The model can understand and generate code that includes organization-specific classes, functions, and libraries.
Faster onboarding of new developers: New developers can quickly familiarize themselves with the codebase by interacting with the fine-tuned model and receiving accurate code suggestions.
Knowledge retention: The fine-tuned model can help retain the knowledge and best practices of your organization's codebase, even as developers come and go.
How to use
To get started with the script provided in this repository, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable to your OpenAI API key. You can obtain an API key by signing up for an OpenAI account.
Place your Python source code files in the same directory as the script or in its subfolders.
Run the prepare_and_finetune.py script using python prepare_and_finetune.py. The script will process your source code files, create a dataset, upload it to OpenAI, and initiate fine-tuning.
Once the fine-tuning is completed, you can use the fine-tuned model with your organization's codebase using the OpenAI API.
Important notes
Make sure to follow OpenAI's guidelines and pricing plans when fine-tuning and using the model. Fine-tuning a model can incur costs based on the model size and the amount of training data.
Be cautious when using the fine-tuned model with sensitive or confidential data. Ensure proper security and privacy measures are in place.
